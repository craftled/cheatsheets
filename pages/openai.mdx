# OpenAI

Here is a basic cheat sheet for working with OpenAI:

- **API Key**: You can find your API key in the OpenAI interface. Click on your profile icon at the top-right corner of the page and select [API keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).
- **Rate Limits**: Free trial users have a rate limit of 20 requests per minute (RPM) and 40,000 tokens per minute (TPM). Pay-as-you-go users have different rate limits based on their usage and subscription plans.
- **Endpoints**: The main endpoint for newer models like gpt-4 and gpt-3.5-turbo is `https://api.openai.com/v1/engines/davinci-codex/completions`.
- **Request Format**: Requests to the API should be POST requests with a JSON body.
- **Response Format**: The API responds with a JSON object. If the request is successful, the `choices` field in the response contains the generated text.
- **Error Handling**: If the API returns an error, it will be in the form of a JSON object with a `message` field.

For more detailed information, please refer to the [OpenAI documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview).
